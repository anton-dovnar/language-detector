# Language Detector

## Project Description

This project is focused on creating a language detection system that can accurately identify the language of a given text document. The system leverages n-grams—sequences of contiguous characters or words—to extract and analyze language-specific patterns. The development process involves several key stages: collecting data from publicly available books in multiple languages, tokenizing the text, generating n-grams, and then identifying the language by comparing the frequency of these n-grams against pretrained language models.

The project utilizes Python libraries for text processing and web scraping. The final product is a robust language detection system that can discern the language of input text. Its modular design allows for straightforward expansion to include additional languages, enhancing its overall effectiveness and accuracy in language identification.
